# Camera Control & Webcam Security Tool

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Windows-based camera security tool** developed during my internship at **Supraja Technologies**.  
It allows users to **enable/disable all connected cameras system-wide**, add **password protection**, and log all activities.  
It also features **real-time camera preview** using OpenCV.

**Internship Duration:** May 24, 2024 – August 24, 2024  
**Internship Role:** Cybersecurity Intern – Web Application Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing  
**Organization:** Supraja Technologies

## 🎯 Features
- **System-wide Camera Control**
  - Enable or disable all detected cameras using PowerShell.
- **Password Protection**
  - Prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Activity Logging**
  - Every action is recorded with timestamp and username.
- **Camera Preview**
  - Test camera functionality in real-time using OpenCV.
- **Device Detection**
  - Robust detection of multiple camera types (Camera, Image, Media devices).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **GUI:** Tkinter  
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV (optional feature)  
- **System Control:** PowerShell PnP Device cmdlets  
- **Logging:** Text-based activity logs

📈 Skills Demonstrated
⦁	Python scripting for hardware control

⦁	GUI development with Tkinter

⦁	Secure authentication & logging

⦁	PowerShell automation

Camera device management

⚠️ Limitations

⦁	Password stored in plain text (password.txt) – should be replaced with a secure hashing mechanism.

⦁	Requires PowerShell execution – works only on Windows with administrator privileges.

⦁	No remote monitoring or alerts for unauthorized attempts.

🔮 Future Improvements
⦁	Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2).

⦁	Send logs to email with SMTP + encryption for real-time alerts.

⦁	Option for cloud backup of logs to a secure server.

⦁	Multi-user role-based access control (admin vs guest access).

⦁	Add cross-platform support for Linux and macOS.

⦁	Real-time threat detection for unknown processes accessing the camera.
